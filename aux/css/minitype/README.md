Minitype
========

A minimalistic type framework to help you keep the vertical rhythm on
your website using modular scales.

To use it just set your desired parameters on the `_config.scss` file
and include `_minitype.scss` on your main sass file

After that you are free to use the built-in variables for the font
size and line height. These are named after LaTeX size conventions.

| Font Size  | Line Heights |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| $f-tiny    | $lh-tiny     |
| $f-small   | $lh-small    |
| $f-large   | $lh-large    |
| $f-Large   | $lh-Large    |
| $f-huge    | $lh-huge     |
| $f-Huge    | $lh-Huge     |
| $f-HUGE    | $lh-HUGE     |

## Mixins

You can also use the included mixins to insert the adjusted headings
and several media queries for responsive design.

    @import 'minitype/minitype'

    // Include the formatted headings adjusted for the chosen scale
    @include includeHeadings();

    // Include the base elements for typographic design
    @include includeBase();

    // Include media queries to adjust the font size
    @include includeMediaQueries();

    // All the above 
    @include minitype();

## Margins and borders

In order to keep the vertical rhythm on the document, we should set
the margins to multiples of the base line height `$lh`. By default,
minitype set `margin-top:0` and `margin-bottom:$lh`. This make it so
the headings will maintain an equal separation. If you wish to set the
headings closer to the element below but you still want to keep the
vertical rhythm you can set the padding so that it compensates the
difference:

    h2 {
      padding-top:   $lh * 0.75;
      margin-bottom: $lh * 0.25;
    }
